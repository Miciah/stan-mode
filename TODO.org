* TODO documentation
* TODO autocomplete mode support
* TODO el-doc support
* TODO compile / execute

I don't consider this high priority, since Makefiles are a better
way of doing this.

** TODO compile stan to cpp
** TODO compile cpp to executable
** TODO run executable associated with model
* TODO semantic mode support

Long run. Write a semantic parser for full language support.
* 

* DONE split into separate packages

- stan-mode
- stan-snippets
- flymake-stan

This makes dependencies modular
