* TODO documentation
* TODO menu

Some sort of menu

* TODO autocomplete mode support
* TODO el-doc support
* TODO compile / execute

I don't consider this high priority, since Makefiles are a better
way of doing this.

** TODO compile stan to cpp
** TODO compile cpp to executable
** TODO run executable associated with model
* TODO cc-mode indentation without deriving from c++ mode

c++-mode has a lot of extra baggage. is it possible to use the
cc-mode indentation engine without deriving the mode from c++-mode?

* TODO semantic mode support

Long run. Write a semantic parser for full language support.
